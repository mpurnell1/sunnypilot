The destination contract over comma's athena connection, for clients away from the
car (comma prime carries the tunnel; auth is the comma account JWT, which belongs in
an app, never a browser). Additive by design: upstream setNavDestination is untouched
and these methods reuse the same handlers as the LAN page, so the two transports
cannot drift.

The relay carries only these rare, user-initiated calls, the same shape and frequency
as upstream's setNavDestination. comma's note to fork maintainers caps prime and
connect usage at openpilot-master capacities, so the sustained state poll and search
live on destinationd's HTTP API, reached directly over wifi or a tailnet.

Gating parity with the page: setting a destination needs offroad or standstill,
cancel works any time. athenad has no vehicle thread, so the gate here is a one-shot
carState read with the same conservative deny when no fresh reading exists.
