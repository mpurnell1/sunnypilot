Live guidance snapshot for the head unit mirror, transport-agnostic like the
destination contract: one navigationd message (3 Hz publisher) serialized to a
plain dict, called by both the LAN page server and the athena RPC so the two
transports cannot drift. active false means navigationd is not publishing, which
covers navigation disabled and the process not running; a client shows the same
nothing either way. distanceFromRoute stays home: raw meters are never drawn,
and what is not served cannot be.
